Module 10 Challenge: SQLAlchemy ORM

Challenge Description
Congratulations on planning your long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To aid in your trip planning, you've decided to conduct a climate analysis of the area.

In this challenge, I leverage Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database.

The repository titled "sqlalchemy-challenge" contains the following files and folders:

climate_starter.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file includes code for reflecting tables into SQLAlchemy ORM and conducting exploratory analysis.

climate_data_app.py: This Python file is designed to create a Flask API based on the queries developed in the Jupyter Notebook.

Resources folder: Contains a screenshot of the landing page of the app and the dataset provided with the starter code.

Feel free to explore the provided code and use the Flask API to retrieve valuable climate-related information for your trip planning. Enjoy your vacation in Honolulu!
